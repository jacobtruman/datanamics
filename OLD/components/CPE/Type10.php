				This hotel has a Teledex phone with a Teledex ExpressPort DSL sled attached to the bottom of it.  The sled has its own power cord that you should check.  On the right-hand side, there is an Ethernet jack with 2 LEDs for Data and Link.  The Link light is an indicator for the connection between the PC and the ExpressPort sled.  The Data light is the indicator for the connection between the switch and the sled.  The Data light comes on immediately once there is a good connection to the switch; it does not sync up like the Netopia and Paradyne CPEs.  There is only a single phone cord running to the sled, and then another connection between the sled and the phone.
